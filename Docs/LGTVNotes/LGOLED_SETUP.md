## HGiG (HDR Gaming Interest Group)
This TV can only make use of `HGiG` if it is receiving `HDR` content in the first place so make sure that your source is outputting `HDR` ([Reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/OLED_Gaming/comments/q5fjox/lg_c1_and_hgig_on_the_series_x/))

When receiving HDR, you will find `HGiG` here: 
* `Picture` -> `Advanced` -> `Brightness` -> `HDR Tone Mapping` -> `HGiG`
